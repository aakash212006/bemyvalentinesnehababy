        <h1>Dear Sneha, My Kiddo ‚ù§Ô∏è</h1>
        <p>You are the most perfect, wholesome, and joyful person in my life. I never want to turn my back on you, and I never want to leave you. Even when you don't listen to me üò≠, I love you endlessly. You are my forever, my one and only. Thank you for being you. I'm sorry for anything that ever upset you, and I promise to love you more every single day. Now, will you be my Valentine? üíï</p>
        <p>Also, I absolutely LOVED the "Will You Be My Valentine" card you gave me! It was the most beautiful, heartwarming, and special thing ever. I stared at it for hours, completely mesmerized by how thoughtful and sweet you are. I kept reading it over and over, feeling my heart melt every single time. It was like a dream come true, a fairytale moment I‚Äôll cherish forever! You truly are the most amazing person in my life, and I can't express how much that card meant to me. It was everything! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
        
        <p class="love-note">I don't know if you will say yes to this, but Sneha, I just asked you to wait a little. I know I am late‚Äîsometimes way too late‚Äîbut honestly, I don‚Äôt know how to handle all this perfectly. And I‚Äôm really sorry... sorry for making you wait in Bandra, for being late everywhere, for making you angry, for everything. I know you‚Äôre tired of hearing me say sorry, and maybe even of me, but I just don‚Äôt know how to fix things alone. If you help me, I promise we can make everything right together. If you‚Äôre with me, I believe we can face anything. Please calm down, and only talk when you feel like it. I just hope our fight ends soon because I really, really hate fighting with you. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
